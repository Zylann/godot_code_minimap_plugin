Code minimap plugin for Godot Engine 3
==========================================

This plugin provides a code minimap next to the usual scrollbar in the script editor.


Installation
-----------------

This is a regular editor plugin. Copy the contents of addons/zylann.code_minimap into the same folder in your project, and activate it in your project settings.


Warning
-------------

This plugin is working with several hacks, because the API this would normally require does not exist yet,
so the code is not as good as I would like to write it, and some basic functions are missing (such as colors).
I made it initially as a proof of concept, but if people like it the needed functions could be requested in Godot.
